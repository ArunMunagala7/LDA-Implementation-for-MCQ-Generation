# LDA-Implementation-for-MCQ-Generation

Implemented Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for sophisticated topic modeling to extract and organize key concepts from extensive textbook PDFs of over 200 pages, effectively managing large context windows.

Utilized the GPT-4-32k model to generate an extensive array of Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) from each extracted topic, leveraging the entire textbook context for optimal question quality.

Developed a Chroma Vector Database using the MiniLM-L6 sentence transformer for effective storage and retrieval of textbook content, facilitating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach.
